                <p>These six resources work most effectively when used in combination rather than isolation. Start with HTML.com or W3Schools for foundational learning, reference MDN for authoritative documentation during assignment work, validate your code with W3C Validator, check accessibility with WAVE, and turn to Stack Overflow when encountering specific problems. This systematic approach ensures comprehensive learning while building professional development habits that extend beyond coursework.</p>
                
                <p>Remember that quality learning requires engaging with multiple perspectives and sources. These resources have been selected to provide different strengths: official authority (MDN, W3C), interactive learning (W3Schools), practical guidance (HTML.com), community wisdom (Stack Overflow), and quality assurance (W3C Validator, WAVE). Using all six creates a complete learning environment that supports both immediate assignment needs and long-term skill development.</p>
